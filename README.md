# Hyper-Big-Bank

### Project proposal
We work for Hyper Big Bank and are in a team that helps meet the investment objectives of High-Net-Worth clients - in the UK a client with more than 10 million pounds sterling (GBP) in assets. At the moment the bank's clients can only invest in four funds which are Hyper Equity, Hyper Tech, Hyper Bonds, Hyper Gold. Due to the increasing focus on crypto as an investment asset, the bank would like to launch a new fund to add to the existing four - Hyper Crypto. After some surveys conducted by the marketing team to evaluate the interest of its investors, the bank would like to build a Machine Learning model to understand which customers would be interested in investing in the new Hyper Crypto fund based on their holdings of [Hyper Equity, Hyper Tech, Hyper Bonds, Hyper Gold] and some other customer attributes.

### Dataset description
After some calls made by the marketing team to understand their customers' interest in the new Hyper Crypto fund, we have a Dataset of 2,000 customers. The Dataset is composed of 12 features, of which 8 have been anonymised for privacy reasons and four correspond to customer ownership of the four funds offered by the bank. More precisely, these are Feat8 corresponding to the customers' holding in Hyper Equity, Feat9 holding in Hyper Tech, Feat10 holding in Hyper Bonds and Feat11 holding in Hyper Gold. Of the 2,000 observations in the Dataset we will work with 1,500 of them as an independent validation team will test our model and the information we provide with the remaining 500 rows.
